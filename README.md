# ZeroByte | Where Privacy Meets Trust in Decentralized Finance

## Overview

ZeroByte is a groundbreaking privacy solution for decentralized finance, implementing a secure private transfer system on the Solana blockchain. Leveraging advanced zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), ZeroByte enables users to transfer SOL tokens with complete confidentiality, concealing transaction amounts and participant addresses from public view.

## Features

- **Private Transfers**: Hide transaction amounts and participant addresses.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove ownership and sufficient balance without revealing sensitive information.
- **Stealth Addresses**: Generate one-time addresses for receiving funds privately.
- **Custom SPL Token**: Implement a Solana token with built-in privacy features.
- **On-chain Verification**: Validate ZKPs within Solana smart contracts.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following key components:

1. **ZKP System**: Generates and verifies zero-knowledge proofs.
2. **Stealth Address System**: Manages creation and recovery of stealth addresses.
3. **Solana Program**: Smart contract for on-chain operations and verification.
4. **Backend API**: Provides high-level methods for initiating and receiving transfers.
5. **Main Service**: Coordinates all components and exposes the API.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Solana CLI tools
- A Solana wallet with some SOL for deployment and transactions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/
   cd 0byte
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Protect private keys and sensitive data carefully.
- Conduct thorough security audits before deploying to mainnet.
- Implement rate limiting and other measures to prevent abuse.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch potential vulnerabilities.
